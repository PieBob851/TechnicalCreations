The start of my terraria mod.

As of right now, functionality is extremely limited & much of the code is from tModLoader tutorials, but the foundation is there.
The intent is to create a tech mod for Terraria. The scope may be expanded on in the future, but for now, the intent is to create a scanner (scanning builds to a file) and a projector (projecting builds from file into the world, and placing blocks from an inventory to complete build).
